# Data Structures Repository

This repository contains implementations of various data structures in Python, focusing on linked lists, doubly linked lists (DLL), and stacks.

## Linked List

A linked list is a linear data structure where elements are stored in nodes, and each node points to the next node in the sequence.

### Implementation

The repository includes a Python implementation of a singly linked list with the following operations:

- Insertion at the beginning, middle, and end of the list
- Deletion from the beginning, middle, and end of the list
- Searching for an element in the list
- Traversing the list
- Checking if the list is empty

## Doubly Linked List (DLL)

A doubly linked list is a variation of the linked list where each node has two pointers: one pointing to the next node and another pointing to the previous node.

### Implementation

The repository includes a Python implementation of a doubly linked list with similar operations as the singly linked list, along with additional operations for traversing the list in reverse.

## Stack

A stack is a linear data structure that follows the Last In, First Out (LIFO) principle, where elements are added and removed from the same end called the top.

### Implementation

The repository includes a Python implementation of a stack with the following operations:

- Push: Adds an element to the top of the stack
- Pop: Removes and returns the element from the top of the stack
- Peek: Returns the element at the top of the stack without removing it
- Checking if the stack is empty

## Important Questions

The repository also includes a collection of important questions related to linked lists, doubly linked lists, and stacks, including but not limited to:

- Reversing a linked list
- Detecting a cycle in a linked list
- Implementing a stack using linked lists
